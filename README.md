# 🧠 Intelligent Document Search and Retrieval System

An AI-powered document retrieval platform built using **Python**, **SQL**, **FastAPI**, and **Hugging Face**.  
The system allows users to perform lightning-fast searches across DOCX, PDF, and code files by combining  
traditional SQL-based keyword search with modern **semantic embedding techniques**, dramatically improving  
information discovery efficiency.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In enterprises and research environments, retrieving the right document from large knowledge bases  
is often time-consuming and inefficient. This project solves that by integrating **semantic search**  
with conventional database indexing — reducing retrieval time from **minutes to seconds**.

### 🔍 Core Capabilities
- Upload and process documents in **DOCX**, **PDF**, and **source code** formats.
- Store structured metadata and content in an **SQL database**.
- Generate **semantic embeddings** using **Hugging Face transformer models**.
- Enable **hybrid search** — combining keyword-based SQL queries and semantic similarity scoring.
- Access results via a **REST API** built with **FastAPI**.
